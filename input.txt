Teaching Your Game

Why do you need to explain your game?
- People have a lot of choice and not a lot of patience
- Quickly bounce off a boring or frustrating start to the game

What makes for a good tutorial?
- Great: "Oh, I didn't need a tutorial, I just figured it out."
- Good: entertaining, teaches you the game
- Bad: feels like work
Flow State also applies to tutorials

How to do it
- Introduce each verb/ability/mechanic one by one
- Give it a mechanical and story context where it makes sense
- Let the player try it out, become more comfortable with it
- Challenge the player for advanced / combined use
How to do it
- Do all of this within a story context that does not feel like a tutorial
- No "your jump jets should now be online, try them out"
- Don't frontload everything

Did I do this in Airships?
- No.
- You need to understand a lot of mechanics to build a simple airship
- No story context
What did I do instead?
- Classic step-by-step tutorial
- Series of ship design and combat challenges
- Tries to keep you on track

Does this work?
- Kind of
- It's a slog
- Many people learn from YouTube instead
What if your game is systems-driven?
- Lots of interlocking systems that the player needs to understand how to play
- This is arguably bad game design
- Example: Airships, Armello
- Clearly not the end of the world, these games are successful
Learnable Game Design
- Subset of mechanics that's fast to learn and already fun
- Baba Is You starts out as Sokoban
- Classic move left/right, jump controls
What does Armello think you need to know?
- The basics of movement and combat
- Play cards and navigate the perils of Armello
- Cast spells and manipulate the kingdom's politics
- Defend against the rot, and discover the different paths that lead to victory
What does Airships need you to know?
- To build a simple airship
- Propulsion, Lift, Crew, Corridor Connections, Weapon Arcs and Exclusions, Access Hatches
- And then there's combat
Airship Tutorial Part 2: The Big Update
- Introduced a whole lot of new strategy mechanics
- Old strategy tutorial was terrible, gave bad advice
- On-rails tutorial would be a lot of work
Advice System
- Advice triggers based on custom code
- Basic hint with option for step-by-step instructions
- Link to manual
